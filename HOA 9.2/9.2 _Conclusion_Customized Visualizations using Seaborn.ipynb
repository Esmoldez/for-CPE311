    "This activity was a new experience for me. In the past, I mostly used Matplotlib for data visualization, but working with Seaborn gave me a fresh perspective. I learned how to use different plots to spot patterns in data like earthquake records and stock prices. I realized that visualizations can make complex data easier to understand, but formatting the graphs, especially the reg_resid_plot, was a challenge. It was tough to process everything at once, but I’m excited to continue learning. Despite the difficulties, this experience has sparked my interest in data science, and I know with more practice, I’ll get better at creating clear and meaningful visuals.\n",
